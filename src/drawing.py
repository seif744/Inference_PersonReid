drawing.py  --  STAGE 5 of the pipeline:  draw bbox + label onto the frame.

============================ THE BIG PICTURE ================================
Detection gives us NUMBERS (box coordinates + confidence). Numbers are hard
to eyeball. So we draw those boxes back ONTO the image, plus a little text
label, and show it in a window. This is purely for US, the humans, to confirm
"yes, it's finding the people correctly". The neural network doesn't need
this; our eyes do. This is called VISUALIZATION or an "annotated frame".

Everything here is done with OpenCV's simple drawing functions, which paint
directly onto the pixel array (they modify the image in place).

Reminder: OpenCV colours are (Blue, Green, Red), each 0-255. So:
  (0, 255, 0)   = pure green
  (0, 0, 255)   = pure red
  (255, 0, 0)   = pure blue
